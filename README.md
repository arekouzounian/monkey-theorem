# Monkey Theorem

A very crude program to recreate a simplified version of [Infinite Monkey Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem)
for Shakespeare's Hamlet. 

This program is simple, inefficient, and was made in less than 30 minutes from start to finish. 
I have included all of hamlet in 'hamlet.txt' as well as a simplified version called 'cleaned.txt'.
You can run the clean script to convert hamlet.txt into clean.txt as well.
